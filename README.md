## AMLISP

### Application-eMbedded LISP

What if every application could have emacs lisp? Amlisp is a 
simple lisp dialect which compiles to extensible bytecode. 
Embedding amlisp in an application is as simple as setting up 
a while loop to execute the bytecode commands.

This project is in early days still.
